# Pokestar

Pokestar is a study project completed in two weeks at the beginning of our training. The website had to be entirely developed using HTML/CSS and Javascript and contain only a single HTML page. We chose to store the various variables and display contents in classes and call them according to the theme selected by the user. 
The project also includes a personality test quiz entirely coded in Javascript among other features that I invite you to discover.
